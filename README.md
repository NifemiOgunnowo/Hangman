# Hangman (Console Game)

## Overview
This project is a **console-based Hangman game** developed in Java as part of a university coursework submission.  
The goal of the project was to strengthen my understanding of **core object-oriented programming concepts** and program structure in Java.

The game runs entirely in the terminal and allows a player to guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts.

This repository is published **for learning and portfolio purposes only**.

## Features
- Text-based Hangman gameplay
- Difficulty options
- Tracking of guessed letters
- Win and lose conditions

---

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub
- **Environment:** Console / Terminal

---

## How It Works
- A word is selected based on the chosen difficulty at the start of the game
- The player guesses one letter at a time
- Correct guesses reveal letters in the word
- Incorrect guesses reduce the remaining attempts
- The game ends when:
  - the word is fully revealed (win), or
  - the player runs out of attempts (loss)

The program is structured using classes and methods to separate concerns such as:
- game logic
- user input handling
